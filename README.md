Coursework Done in CS-230: Operating Platforms

The Gaming Company is a company specializing in games for Android systems. In this project, the company asked me to expand the game to have desktop compatibility. The software should be fully functional across all browsers and operating systems, and adhere to all of the requirements of the software or system. This documentation goes over the plans and design for this trasition to desktop. In this documentation, I would say that I did well in describing a thorough plan to do this transition, as well as ensure that their is enough room for improvement and a bigger player base. From designing the software on this document, the code was more planned out and and well-written. If i had to revise one part of the code, I would revise the operatin system possiblly. Instead of Linux, I would possibly have the back-end written on Windows, due to wide popularity and functionality. I implemented the user's needs into my software by allowing for a smooth experience with things such as improved picture rendering due to higher memory usage, using cloud-based storage for data, and a clean UI for the user. To design this sofware, I ensured it was planned out well and using high-quality and functional code.
